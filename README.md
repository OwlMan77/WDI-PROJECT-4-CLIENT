##Front End 
Before full starting my project from the front-end. I ensured that JWT token authentication was my first priority. 



##What I would of done differently?

* Spend longer on Model planning. 

During the project time was a little rushed as I was suffering from a bad cold for a couple of days and it meant I had to go back and make changes to my models multiple times. I what I hope to improve on this project is to add a model that allows for user Dosage and view for User Medication.

* Spend longer on Styling 

Personally would love to have spent longer on styling. Originally I was going to move for a Swiss design but due to time constraints I had to make a basic CSS version. I will be working on this during my spare time.

##Things to add

* Bar Chart for Overall Medications
* Dosage Model
* Add a new view which would contain User medication and User dosage.

##Modules  

###Node
* Angular
* Chart.js 

###Css
* Framework
	* Bootstrap

###Backend 
* Ruby-on-Rails API
